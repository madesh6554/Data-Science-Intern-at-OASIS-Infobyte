# Data-Science-Intern-at-OASIS-Infobyte

As a Data Science Intern at OASIS Infobyte, the project involved applying data
 analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Key tasks
 included cleaning and preprocessing datasets, building predictive models using
 libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and visualizing data through Matplotlib
 and Seaborn. The internship focused on enhancing practical skills in Python
 programming, model evaluation, and improving performance through
 hyperparameter tuning.
